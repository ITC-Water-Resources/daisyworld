    "**Daisyworld Exercise, Roelof Rietbroek, updated Jan 2020**\n",
    "\n",
    "Daisyworld [1] is an hypothetical planet which has only 2 types of organisms. white and black daisies. These daisies differ in that they reflect sunlight in different amounts, and one can guess that white daisies reflect sunlight much better than black daisies. Because of these reflection characteristics (albedo) they can alter the climate of the planet given an amount of incoming solar radiation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the daisies can reproduce themselves and the rate at which this is happening depends on the local temperature close to the daisies. This creates an interesting feedback mechanism which is going to be studied in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performing the exercise\n",
    "This exercise is intended to give you insights in the concepts of albedo , Stefan Boltzmann law and the non-linear systems. Another intention is to allow you to gain some programming experience in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise consists of implementing the [Equations of Daisyworld](#the-equations-of-daisyworld), and subsequently executing [2 experiments](#experiments) to see how the planet responds to different solar forcing."
